# Task

The task consists of two parts: frontend and backend. The backend part is optional.
The solution should be provided to us as a public GIT repository.
All dependencies should be installed by running `npm install`. There should be README file to tell us how to run your solution - there should be one script doing it (e.g. `gulp start`)

# Frontend

Create a screen that presents list of users, based on the provided mockup. It should allow to create new users and modify/remove existing ones. Even if you don't do the backend part, implement frontend as if there was backend to it.

# Backend (optional)

Create backend in Node.js or Java. You don't have to use database, just keep the data in memory.

# General remarks

You will get additional points for:

- tests
- automated build
- proper use of tools
- clean code
- separation of responsibilities
- small commits (to show your progress)
